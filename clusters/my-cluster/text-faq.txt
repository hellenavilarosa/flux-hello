Shoes/Brands

Q:
How do I know my shoe size?
    A:

    If you are unsure of your shoe size, you can measure your shoe size. Because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock device® can only approximate your true shoe size. Please also keep in mind that manufacturers use different lasts to construct their shoes, and sizing may vary accordingly.
     

Q:
I want to know if you carry a specific brand/color/size/width?
    A:

    Try clicking Brands button located at the top of each page - you will be taken to a page where you can view all brands that we are currently offering. Please check back often since we add new brands on a daily basis! Or if you know what you're looking for - try the search bar as well.

Q:
Do you have a catalog?
    A:

    No. Currently, we have a 'virtual' catalog. In order to ensure that our customers have access to the most current styles, prices, sizes, and overall selection, we do not publish a catalog that you may purchase directly from us. Plus, with all the styles that we carry, a catalog would be as big as a phone book! If there is a particular shoe or style of shoe that you are interested in, please feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help you locate it.

Q:
I tried to check out and the item in my shopping cart disappeared, what happened?
    A:

    We are sorry that you were not able to complete your order. The selection on Zappos.com is live and reflects what is in stock at that moment. Placing an item in your shopping cart does not guarantee your right to purchase that item. Until you have completed the checkout process, another customer may purchase the item even if it is in your cart.If that happens, you will receive a message on the shopping cart page informing you that the item is no longer available and that you should remove it from your cart.
     

Q:
Is the item I want going to go on sale soon?
    A:

    Unfortunately, Zappos.com does not know if an item will go on sale or be marked down until it actually happens. It is possible for different colors within the same style to have different prices. For instance, if a blue bag is selling better than a yellow one, one might discount the yellow bag to boost sales.
     

Q:
My email address has changed. How do I update this information to my current account?

        Visit the website and click on "My Account" in the upper right-hand corner of the page.

        Verify your "Current password" at the bottom.

        Click "Update Now."

The item I want is out of stock. What do I do now?

    Zappos.com is very sorry that the item that you need is out of stock. Underneath the size selection dropdown menu, there is a link that says "Don't see your size?".

Q:
Do you accept orders through VOIP?
    A:

We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause.
     

Q:
How do I care for XYZ fabric?
    A:

    Acetate: While most items made of acetate are dry-clean only, some may be hand-washed in lukewarm water. Do not twist the fabric. Iron while the fabric is damp. Press the inside of the garment using a low-temperature setting. Use a pressing cloth when ironing the outside.

    Acrylic knit: Most acrylic knit garments can be machine-washed. Read the label, and check for the proper drying option. Some knits retain their shapes best if reshaped and dried flat.

    Cashmere: Check the care label before laundering cashmere. To hand-wash, use a mild detergent or shampoo. Gently squeeze the water through the garment, then rinse until the water runs clear. Do not wring or twist. Squeeze out excess water. To dry, lay flat on a towel, away from sunlight or heat.

    Cotton: Cotton holds up well to home laundering. Remove the garment from the dryer promptly to reduce wrinkling. Press using spray starch for the crispness of a laundered shirt.

    Cotton blend: Dry cotton-blend garments using your dryer's permanent-press or low-heat cycle, and remove immediately to reduce wrinkling. Touch up with a steam iron; starch for a professionally laundered look.

    Linen: Most linen garments need to be dry-cleaned or hand-washed. Follow the instructions on the care label. To touch up or press, use a steam iron on a linen setting for a crisp look.

    Nylon: Machine-wash nylon garments in warm water. Use a low-temperature setting when tumble-drying, and include a dryer sheet to reduce static electricity. Use a warm iron to press, if necessary.

    Polyester: Read the label. Usually polyester items can be machine-washed (cool) and dried (low). Check the label to see if air-drying is recommended. Touch up with a cool – never hot – iron, if necessary.

    Rayon: Make sure to read the care label for rayon clothing. Launder in cool water and a mild detergent. When machine-washing, use the gentle cycle and promptly remove garments after washing. When hand-washing, do not wring or twist the garment. To dry, roll the item in a towel to squeeze out excess water. Lay flat to dry. Iron when still damp and with the garment inside out to prevent the fabric from becoming shiny. Use a pressing cloth when ironing the right side of the garment. Pressing cloths can be purchased, or use something as simple as a piece of white cotton fabric.

    Silk: Dry cleaning may be required. Some silks are hand- or machine-washable. Do not dry silk in a clothes dryer. Garments usually look best when professionally dry-cleaned.

    Spandex: Use warm water when hand- or machine-washing items made with spandex. Line-dry or use a low temperature setting when machine-drying to preserve the elasticity of the garment.

    Wool knit: Typically wool knits need to be dry-cleaned, but check the label. If hand-washable, use cool water and a detergent for fine washables. Squeeze out excess water, then reshape and dry flat.

    Wool (lined): Lined garments generally look best when professionally dry-cleaned once a season. Between dry cleanings, remove surface soil with a brush or damp cloth. Refresh the item by hanging it from a padded hanger in a steamy bathroom; moisture will help garment shed wrinkles. When touching up with an iron, use steam in an up-and-down motion (rather than sliding the iron along the fabric).
     

Q:
What is a Zappos Verified Purchase review?
    A:

    An "Zappos Verified Purchase" review means we've verified that the person writing the review purchased the product at Zappos. Reviews that are not marked "Zappos Verified Purchase" are valuable as well, but we can't confirm that the product was purchased at Zappos.

Q:
Do you ship internationally?
    A:

Zappos is not responsible for any claims for damage or missing items after successful delivery to the Freight Forwarding business.
     

Suspicious Activity

Q:
I received an email from Zappos.com regarding an order I didn’t place. What should I do?
    A:

    If you received correspondence regarding an order you didn’t place, it likely wasn’t from Zappos.com. Don't share any personal information, click any links in the email, or respond to the email, and delete it immediately.

    This type of email is known as a phishing campaign. A phishing campaign is an email scam designed to steal personal information from victims. Cybercriminals use phishing, the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as credit card details and login credentials, by disguising themselves as a trustworthy organization or reputable person in an email communication.

    If you are a Zappos.com customer, you can go to your Zappos Account and view Your Order History to see if there is an order that matches the details in the correspondence. If you are not a Zappos.com customer, feel free to contact us to verify whether the email is associated with an actual order.
     

Q:
How do I identify whether an Email is or is not from Zappos?
    A:

    Suspicious or fraudulent emails not from Zappos.com may contain:

        A reference to a payment source that Zappos.com does not accept, such as PayPal. Zappos.com currently only accepts credit cards, debit cards, and Zappos.com Gift Cards for payment.
        A request to update payment information that is not linked to an order you placed on Zappos.com or your Zappos.com account.
        Links, including “Here” links, to websites not affiliated with Zappos.com. You should be able to hover over a link without clicking it to show the website address associated with the link. If the link shows a site other than Zappos.com or a site that is not a legitimate Zappos domain, then it is likely phishing.
        An order confirmation for an item you didn't purchase or an attachment to an order confirmation. If you are a Zappos.com customer, go to your Zappos Account and view Your Order History to see if there is an order that matches the details in the correspondence. If you are not a Zappos.com customer, feel free to contact us to verify whether the email is associated with an actual order.
        Typos, grammatical errors, or unconventional formatting.
        A generic email address with Zappos in the email, for example advert@gmail.com or an email address from a non-US country or site not associated with Zappos. Zappos will never send communications from personal or generic email accounts. Order-related emails typically come from cs-noreply@zappos.com or another zappos.com email address.
        Forged email addresses to make it look like the email is coming from Zappos.com. Your email program may allow you to hover over or click on an email address to view its original source.

     

Q:
What should I do if I believe I’ve received a phishing email or if I responded to what may be a phishing email?
    A:

    If you believe you received a phishing email or responded to what may be a phishing email, Zappos recommends you update your online passwords, including the password to your Zappos.com Account, and report the email to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Visit the FTC website here to report the email and find more information on how to identify and prevent phishing attacks.
     

Payment Information

Q:
Do you accept international credit cards?
    A:

    Currently Zappos.com can accept international credit cards but we can only ship to an address within the United States and its territories. Please note that the credit card must be issued and contain a logo from either Visa, Mastercard, Discover, or American Express. On the checkout page, there will be a billing and shipping section. Please do the following:

    For the billing information

    Enter your street address on Address Line 1. Enter your City, County or Province, and Postal Code on Address Line 2. Enter your Country  for the city. Enter AA for the state. Enter 11111 for the zip code.

    Please enter the correct information in the appropriate field.

    Orders placed with the use of an International Credit Card may take up to 72 hours to finalize prior to shipping. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
     

Q:
Do you allow Cashier's Checks or Money Orders?

Q:
What can cause my order to be delayed?
    A:

        If the billing information you provided does not match what your bank has on file (including address and telephone number), your order may be delayed.
        We all love sending gifts to others and ourselves as much as we love receiving them. However, if you are shipping to an address other than your billing address, your order may be delayed.

     

Q:
Can I pay with multiple Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover Pre-Paid Gift Cards?
    A:

    Any pre-paid gift card with a Visa, Mastercard, American Express, or Discover logo / insignia on it will be processed like an actual credit / debit card and only one credit card can be used per order. If a single pre-gift card does not cover the total of your order, we suggest using the balance on the pre-paid gift card to purchase a Zappos Gift Certificate. The Zappos Gift Certificate can then be used along with a credit card or pre-paid gift card to complete the order. If you have multiple pre-paid gift cards, you will need to purchase a separate Zappos Gift Certificate for each. If you need any help with purchasing the Zappos Gift Certificates or placing an order, please give our Customer Loyalty Team a call, and we will be happy to help! Please also note that in order to use the pre-paid gift card on Zappos, it will need to be registered or activated by following the instructions on the pre-paid gift card itself or on the card’s packaging. Also, some card may not be eligible for online purchases. Please refer to the company that issued the card for more details.
     

Amazon Pay

Q:
What is Amazon Pay?
    A:

    Amazon Pay is a service that allows Amazon customers to use the payment information already stored in their Amazon account to pay for goods and services on other sites. You can use Amazon Pay wherever you see it - whether that is clicking the Amazon Pay button when checking out on your favorite online stores, managing your payment methods in your account on Amazon.com or using Amazon Pay on Alexa. There are no additional sign-ups or sign-ins. Your transactions are safe and secure, and everything can be tracked in your Amazon account.

That also includes your address book, so you’ll always have Grandmom’s address handy no matter where you shop.
     

Q:
How do I find my Amazon Pay transactions?
    A:

    Go to pay.amazon.com and sign in as a “shopper” using your Amazon username and password. One-time purchases are shown on the “Activity” tab, and subscription agreements are on the “Merchant agreements” tab. You can also view your transactions on Amazon.com.

If you are in the Amazon app, all transactions are listed together under “Your Orders” or in “Your Account”.
     

Q:
What does it cost to use Amazon Pay?
    A:

    It costs nothing. Using Amazon Pay does not add fees to your purchases on sites and organizations accepting Amazon Pay. Amazon Pay does not add transaction fees, membership fees, currency conversion fees, foreign transaction fees, or any other fees. Your card issuer, however, may add a foreign transaction fee if your card was issued in a country different from the site on which you are shopping, as well as any other fees described in the terms and conditions for your card.
